# Database Touch and Go

Pilots practice take-off and landing using a procedure called "Touch and Go".  The pilot takes off, circles the airport, then lands with the landing gear only breifly touching the deck before they take back off again, and repeat the process.  By practicing over and over, in different conditions, in different planes, they master the most dangerous aspects of flight by reducing it to muscle memory.

It occurred to me that while we have in-class exercises, and a metric crap-ton of homework, there really isn't any practice material.

I created this to help my bootcamp students practice a set of critical skills focusing on using the MySQL command line prompt.

Why not use workbench?  Because much of the time the only access you have to the database is via an SSH session which precludes using a GUI.  But even if you can use a GUI, working in the command window is very fast and effective, and it's a critical skill.

Don't get me wrong - I use a GUI for creating tables, especially those with foreign key relationships.  But the majority of my database work is hacking commands.

This was put together fairly quickly, and I'm sure it's not perfect, but I think it's good enough to benefit you if you need a practice exercise.
